 java android scroll imageview glide  ,    I have a list which contains posts that each contain one image. The ImageView width is set to match_parent so it's always the same. Thee ImageView height is set to wrap_content so the image height is not always the same. The last thing is what causes a problem with scrolling because I'm also using Glide. The system doesn't know how far it has to scroll until Glide loads the picture gets the dimensions of it and then resizes the ImageView. When the picture is done loading and the ImageView height is set the list \jumps\ and the screen shows another post. This is solved when wrap_content is replaced by a fixed value but this is not what I want because in that case there's a lot of empty space around the picture for some images.Is there any other way to achieve what I want?Edit: the solution works but it was still not what we wanted to achieve. We ended up changing the JSON. It now shows a ratio as well with which the size of the ImageView can be calculated before the picture is loaded. This way the ImageView has a fixed size anyway but it's an individual fixed size.,    Android: list jumps to other post when scrolling because ImageView height is wrap_content

 android android-studio version  ,    I'm using Android Studio .. and when opened an activity layout normally the preview should appear on the right side so that I can switch between Text and Design mode which should again show the preview of the layout. But no preview is shown not on the right side neither when I'm in text mode nor in the design mode. I just get the error rendering problems...When I compile everything and install the app on my device it works without any errors. For developing and experimenting with the layout it would still be nice if I could get the preview to work.I have also tried to switch between different devices in the studio but no success. Does anyone know how solve this?,    Android Studio rendering problems

 android material-design android-support-library ,    This GIF pretty much shows what I am talking about:<a href=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/uCej.gif\ rel=ofollow noreferrer\><img src=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/uCej.gif\ alt=\The Bug in Action\></a>I have a fairly complicated DrawerLayout -> CoordinatorLayout -> ViewPager -> Fragment -> RecyclerView situation going on in my app.When a user long clicks on one of the items in the RecyclerView it sends a Broadcast to the ParentActivity which then signals the BottomSheet to appear.Usually it works fine but every once in a while the BottomSheet doesn't appear. I have a FrameLayout that acts as an overlay between the ParentActivity and the ViewPager. When you click the Overlay it tells the BottomSheet to collapse. You can see in the GIF above that in situations when the BottomSheet does not appear it still animates on collapse.This behavior happens pretty frequently on my Nexus  Genymotion (API ) emulator. On real devices it almost never happens but it does sometimes.What I have noticed is that if I do the long click and hold until the BottomSheet appears it always appears. It's when I release immediately after the long click is registered that the BottomSheet might not appear.I'm fairly certain that this is a situation where the RecyclerView is interfering in some way but I can't really figure out why or how. Any debugging tips would be appreciated.For reference here is the layout in question:&lt,    Bottom Sheet doesn&#;t appear sometimes in complicated view

 python list python-.x while-loop  ,I have a problem where I need to (pretty sure at least) go through the entire list to solve. The question is to figure out the largest number of consecutive numbers in a list that add up to another (greater) element in that list. If there aren't any then we just take the largest value in the list as the candidate summation and  as the largest consecutive number of elements.my general code works but not too well for large lists (> elements) just looking for tips as to how I could approach the problem different. My current approach:L = []candidate_sum = L[-]largest_count =  N = len(L)i = while i &lt; N - :    s = L[i]    j =     while s &lt;= (N - L[i + j + ]):        j +=         s += L[i+j]        if s in L and (j+) &gt; largest_count:             largest_count = j+             candidate_sum = s    i+=In this case the answer would be [] as they add up to  and the length is  (obviously this example L is a very simple example)I then made it faster by changing the initial while loop condition to:while i &lt; (N-)/largest_countnot a great assumption but basic thinking that the distribution of numbers is somewhat uniform so two numbers on the second half of the list are on average bigger than the final number in the list and therefore are disqualified.Im just looking for:<ul>possible bottleneckssuggestions as to different approaches to try</ul>,speeding up python code that has to go through entire list

I already tried everything at <a href=\""http://stackoverflow.com/questions//django-haystack-show-results-without-needing-a-search-query][]\"">Django Haystack - Show results without needing a search query?</a>It doesn't seem to work for me though to subclass the Searchform.My Code:forms.py:class CustomSearchForm(SearchForm):    def no_query_found(self):        print('no query')        return self.searchqueryset.all()search.html: &lt;form method=\""get\"" action=\"".\""&gt;    {{ form.as_table }}    &lt;button&gt;hit&lt;/button&gt;    &lt;/form&gt;...        {% if query or page_obj %}            {% for result in page_obj.object_list %}                    &lt;div class=\""col-md-\""&gt;                        &lt;div class=\""cell\""&gt;                            &lt;div class=\""description\""&gt;                                {{ result.object.Studiengang }}                            &lt;/div&gt;                        &lt;/div&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;                    &lt;div class=\""col-md-\""&gt;                        &lt;div class=\""cell\""&gt;                            &lt;div class=\""description\""&gt;                                &lt;p&gt;{{ result.object.Bildungsinstitut }}&lt;/p&gt;...                {% empty %}                    &lt;p&gt;No results found.&lt;/p&gt;                {% endfor %}            {% if page_obj.has_previous or page_obj.has_next %}                &lt;div&gt;                    {% if page_obj.has_previous %}                        &lt;a href=\""?                                {% if urlquery %}{% for key value in urlquery.items %}&amp;{{ key }}={{ value }}{% endfor %}{% endif %}&amp;amp;page={{ page_obj.previous_page_number }}\""&gt;{% endif %}&amp;laquo;                    Zurück{% if page_obj.has_previous %}&lt;/a&gt;{% endif %}                    |                    {% if page_obj.has_next %}                        &lt;a href=\""?                                {% if urlquery %}{% for key value in urlquery.items %}&amp;{{ key }}={{ value }}{% endfor %}{% endif %}&amp;amp;page={{ page_obj.next_page_number }}\""&gt;{% endif %}                    Weiter &amp;raquo;{% if page_obj.has_next %}&lt;/a&gt;{% endif %}                &lt;/div&gt;            {% endif %}        {% else %}            {# Show some example queries to run maybe query syntax something else? #}        {% endif %}views.py:class MySearchView(SearchView):    \""\""\""My custom search view.\""\""\""def get_queryset(self):    urlquery = self.request.GET.copy()    queryset = super(MySearchView self).get_queryset()    if urlquery:        if 'filterbildungsart' in urlquery:            queryset = queryset.filter(Bildungsart=urlquery['filterbildungsart'])        if 'filterfachbereich' in urlquery:            queryset = queryset.filter(Fachbereich=urlquery['filterfachbereich'])        if 'order_up_Studiengang' in urlquery:            return queryset.order_by('Studiengang')        elif 'order_down_Studiengang'in urlquery:            return queryset.order_by('-Studiengang')        elif 'order_up_Bildungsinstitut' in urlquery:            return queryset.order_by('Bildungsinstitut')        elif 'order_down_Bildungsinstitut'in urlquery:            return queryset.order_by('-Bildungsinstitut')        else:            return queryset    else:        return querysetI've shortened the html-code for visibility and hope everything relevant is there.What happens at different urls:All results - ...:/de/search/No results - ...:/de/search/?&amp;order_up_BildungsartNo results - ...:/de/search/?&amp;filterbildungsart=BachelorNo results - ...:/de/search/?q=All results - ...:/de/search/?q=Deutschland(q=Deutschland is a query which all indexed items have in common right now; results are ordered as intended)All results - ...:/de/search/?q=Deutschland&amp;filterfachbereich=Ingenieurwissenschaften&amp;order_up_BildungsartMy Problem is also that I seem to be not able to get into the code from my form.

 python keras  ,I design neural network with the dynamic amount of inputs. My idea is to process set of data with shared model then average/maximum their results and place classifier on top of it.After reading documentation i was sure that it is possible using Keras but i faced problem that keras.layers.average can receive only input tensors. But i need to make this operation over models or other layers instead.Here is code i have nowinputs = [Input((countInputCount))]  # count is always heredowns = []for i in range(count):        inputs.append(Input((inputCount)))        downs.append(sharedDown(inputs[-]))avg = keras.layers.average(downs)max = keras.layers.maximum(downs)middle = keras.layers.concatenate([inputs[] avg max])For this i got next error: ValueError: A merge layer should be called on a list of inputs.Probably i understand this error incorrectly. Any help will be highly appreciated.Thank you.,Keras: How to make average/maximum operation on top of some layers results?

The X and Y axes are perfect but the colormap spreads between the min and max of v. I would like to force the colormap to range between  and .I thought of using:plt.axis(...)To set the ranges of the axes but this only takes arguments for the min and max of X and Y not the colormap.Edit:For clarity let's say I have one graph whose values range ( ... .) and another graph whose values (. ... .).In both graphs I will want the range of the colorbar to be ( ... ). In both graphs I want this range of colour to be identical using the full range of cdict above (so . in both graphs will be the same colour). In the first graph all colours between . and . won't feature in the graph but will in the colourbar key at the side.

Moreover comparing websites position in GSC is awkward.  Also when I manage multiple GSC account I think so it's a good idea to do sth like automatically exporting data from GSC.First what comes to my mind is to use Google Search Console API and then download data using for example Python etc. But there are some problems - multiple accounts + I want to do it every day. Then I want to put the data into something like BigQuery or other cloud database storage to make it accessible to my colleagues.  Also I need a tool data visualization which will show me thinks like this:- Growth of organic search traffic during some period of time - Changes in  not found errors during some period of time.Do you advice me to use some available software for it (if any)?  Or better to write custom software in Python or R to downloading data from GSC putting it to database and then visualise? I am looking for your ideas.
